# State of RSS

In this repository we will collect the responses to our annual [State of RSS](https://feeder.co/blog/473-state-of-rss-survey-2020) survey.

In the survey we ask `Are you ok with your anonymized responses being open sourced for community analysis?` We have removed any answers where the response was "No", but kept responses that did not respond to the question.

We have also omitted any `Other (please specify)` since we saw instances of people disclosing personal information. We also scrubbed IP's, e-mails and other PII.

Want to talk? I'm Erik at erik@feeder.co.
